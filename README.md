# rxui-splunk
Playground for figuring out how to structure views and view models in RxUi.

Hoping to get examples of the following:
- [ ] tabs on a screen (might turn out to be unnecessary)
- [X] Load and replace to switch screens
  - accomplished by demo buttons and main content area
- [X] Master/detail (select an entry in a list and see details in a separate panel)
  - accomplished by varying pets screen (see commented code in the view for how to get a string instead of a fully rendered view)
- [X] List of varying classes and rendered entries
  - accomplished by varying pets screen
- [ ] A view embedded in a view
  - partially accomplished (still want to add communication from inner VM to outer VM)
- [ ] Pop open a window
- [ ] Display a modal
- [ ] Loading/busy indicator that blocks user interaction with the screen
